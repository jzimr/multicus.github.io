<h2 class="section-heading">The problem</h2>
<p><i>We have five philosophers, each with their own plate of spaghetti and five chopsticks placed around in a circle: </i></p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/default-layout-phil.png" alt="Demo Image">

<p><i>The pondering philosophers eventually need food in order to keep thinking, but to satisfy everyone's hunger at once we would 
need 10 chopsticks, and we only have 5 in total! Even worse, the philosophers can only grab the two chopsticks closest to them.</i></p>

<p>Given that each philosopher has no information about any other philosopher, we have to solve this synchronization problem of who
can access the chopsticks and when with a guarantee that no problems will arise.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">So what's the holdup?</h2>

<p>The first obvious solution that might come to mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Philosopher is now hungry.</li>
    <li>Philosopher waits until right chopstick is available. If yes, pick up.</li>
  <li>Philosopher waits until left chopstick is available. If yes, pick up.</li>
  <li>Philosopher has now both chopsticks and eats.</li>
  <li>Philosopher has finished eating.</li>
  <li>Put right chopstick back on table.</li>
  <li>Put left chopstick back on table.</li>
  <li>Repeat from start.</li>
</ul> 

<p>This would work well in one-threaded applications where you check for one philosopher at a time. 
In our case, however, there is one thread (or process!) per philosopher, making this method prone to deadlocks. 
I.e. if all philosophers are hungry and request the right chopstick simultaneously, they will
all be placed in a queue waiting for the left chopstick, stuck in a demonic loop; Everyone will be waiting for everyone to finish.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">An alternative solution</h2>

<p>Let's say the philosophers alternate between 3 states: <b>Thinking, Hungry</b> and <b>Eating</b>:

<ul>
<li>Thinking: The philosopher does nothing (except to think, of course).</li>
<li>Hungry: The philosopher needs food. If no chopsticks are available, he will keep staying hungry until
he gets grab of two chopsticks.</li> 
<li>Eating: The philosopher has got ahold of two chopsticks. He will eat until done, then
put the chopsticks back onto the table and return to thinking.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The solution I will be using is based off Tanenbaum's "Modern Operating Systems" with a few tweaks for the C++ implementation.

Why not use semaphores?

<div id="spoiler" style="display:none">
<p><i>Tanenbaum's original algorithm uses POSIX semaphores. I developed the simulation on Windows and was therefore restricted to use mutexes instead.
Both semaphores and mutexes work equally well. If you want another solution using semaphores, <b>I got another small project you can take a look at:</i>
